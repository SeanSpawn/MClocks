See [the document about config.json](https://github.com/bayashi/mclocks/blob/main/docs/about-config-json.md) for more details.

## Window state file

If you want to reset your mclock where it's located in your screen, then please try to remove `window-state.json` in your App data directory. That file would be generated by mclock automatically to keep the location and the size of your mclocks.
